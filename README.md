<h1>Netflix-Clone</h1>

<p>
  I designed Netflix-Clone using the Redux-Thunk library. I chose a random movie by making a request to the original API. Again, using different features of the same API, I listed the current popular movies in 20 different categories. By clicking on any movie in this list, you can access the summary of the movie and related content about the movie.</p>
